# Binary Trees Practice Repository

Welcome to the Binary Trees Practice Repository! Here, you'll discover a curated collection of binary tree problems aimed at sharpening your skills in working with binary trees.

## About Binary Trees

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are fundamental in computer science and are used in various algorithms and data structures.

## Contributions

Contributions are highly encouraged! If you've tackled a binary tree problem that's not listed here, don't hesitate to submit a pull request with your solution implementation along with relevant test cases. Together, we can build a comprehensive resource for mastering binary trees.

## Support
