# Greedy Algorithms Practice Repository

Welcome to the Greedy Algorithms Practice Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of greedy algorithm questions that I've practiced to enhance my understanding and proficiency in using greedy techniques.

## About Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are often used for optimization problems where they can provide near-optimal or optimal solutions.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you've solved a greedy algorithm problem that's not included here, feel free to submit a pull request with your solution implementation along with test cases.

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to open an issue in the repository. I'll do my best to address it promptly.
